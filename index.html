								<span class="image main"><img src="images/about.jpg" alt="me" /></span>
								<p>My name is Tyler. I'm an aspiring developer. I find designing and building apps/software/websites interesting and rewarding. Finding new solutions and solving issues with code is a fun way to work, and when a project comes together or even a small feature functions properly it gives a sense of pride and accomplishment. My intertest in IT started with building and tinkering with computers. I love finding new ways to improve systems or projects. This love for computers and technology lead me to a formal education in Business Information Technology at Red River college, where I graduated the program with honours. <br> When I'm not in front of a computer I enjoy hockey, photography, reading, and video games. I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Manitoba where I majored in Painting and a Certificate of Applied Accounting from Red River College.</p>
